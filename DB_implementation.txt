DROP existing DB-> Create entity tables -> Generalization done by associating PK of user with PK of type (AlumniID etc.)
-> Create Relation tables -> Populate tables

% SET FOREIGN KEYS?????

The first thing the code does is remove the existing tables that are going to be used.

% CODIGO DROP TABLES 

Then the new tables are created by defining the its name, primary key, atributes and the type of variable each atribute is.
Because each type of student (Alumni, Organization member and Student) is represented by a table, but their primary key is the \textit{UserID}, those tables also had that same key but with a different name. That association is done through the command \textit{references}

% CODIGO CREATE TABLES

The last part was just populating the tables with information.

% CODIGO INSERT INTO
